# Algorithmic-Semantic-Primitives

## TO-DO
[ ] Compile dictionaries from Wiktionary
[ ] Convert to graph + lemmatization
[ ] Run Genetic Algorithm
[ ] Compare Word Embeddings

## Dictionaries
As of now the plan is to use Russian, Turkish, and Vietnamese, though Russian can be swapped for pretty much any Indo-European language
This is because they appear to have reasonably large wiktionaries, which means we shouldn't have a poverty of data, and each is included in the MUSE word embeddings and STANZA lemmatizer, so we shouldn't lack tools

See https://github.com/tatuylonen/wiktextract/tree/master for the source of the parser used for Russian
